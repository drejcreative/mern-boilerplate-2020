# MERN Stack starter

My personal MERN stack starter boilerplate, so I dont have to type it every time from scratch. It is optimized for React single page app, as if you would not use single page app then Next.je is better suggestion. I added simple but efective Todo app just to show all features annd to have setup and test all the routes, and react state management.


> Node, ExpressJs and MongoDB in backend.

> Frontend is latest React with Hooks, useContext with useReducer instead of Redux. Css Modules and css variables included.
